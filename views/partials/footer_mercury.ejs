<p>"Zipping around the sun in only 88 days, Mercury is the closest planet to the 
sun, and it's also the smallest, only a little bit larger than Earth's moon. 
Because its so close to the sun (about two-fifths the distance between Earth and
the sun), Mercury experiences dramatic changes in its day and night temperatures
: Day temperatures can reach a scorching 840  F (450 C), which is hot enough to 
melt lead. Meanwhile on the night side, temperatures drop to minus 290 F (minus 
180 C)."</p>
